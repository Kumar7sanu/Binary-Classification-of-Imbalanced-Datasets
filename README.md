# Binary-Classification-of-Imbalanced-Datasets
## Project Summary:

In this project, I utilized Python to perform binary classification of imbalanced datasets, which is a common problem in machine learning. The project involved identifying imbalanced data using statistical analysis, applying various techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data, and developing a binary classification model using machine learning algorithms.

I utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to preprocess the data, visualize the dataset, and train and test the model. The project aimed to improve the accuracy and performance of the classification model while ensuring that the minority class is not overlooked.

The binary classification of imbalanced datasets project showcases proficiency in Python programming, machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The findings of this project can be useful for decision-making in areas such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and credit risk assessment.
